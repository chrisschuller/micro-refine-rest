# Micro Refine REST

In this repository, I tried to implement a resorce-based data fetching approach like in [refine.dev](https://refine.dev/)

This is currently a React app with a backend based on the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) package, but the plan is to publish the functionality as a separate NPM package.

## Usage

- `npm install`
- `npm run backend`
- `npm run frontend`

## Resetting the DB

Reset the values of the database directly in the `src/db/db.json` file.
